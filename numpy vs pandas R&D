    Numpy is a python library which is used to work with multi dimensional array . Numpy is 50X faster than list . 

    Using numpy we can work with large data sets and perform mathematical operations to get data fast .

    Advantage of using numpy :

    1. Numpy is 50x faster than normal list in python . Because Numpy stores data continously one ny one so that we can access data very fast
       whereas inbuilt list cant store data one by one in computers.Is stores data but data is unstructured

    2. Numpy tool is Arrays
    3.Indexing is very fast in numpy . 
    4. In python we have only one dimentional using numpy we can work with multi dimentional arrays .se


---------------------------------------------------------->    Pandas   <-----------------------------------------------
    pandas is also a python library . It is a top of numpy which is used to work with data manipulation and analysis.

    Pandas tool is datafame and series

    Pandas work with manipulation of tables , inserting, groupingn , and large sets of data manipulations

    It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.



Difference betweeen pandas and numpy 

Pandas:when we have tabular form we can use pandas to data manipulation .

Numpy : when we have numerical data we can use numpy arrays .

Pandas : Pandas consume more memory 

Numpy  : Numpy consumes less memory 

pandas : Indexing is slow in pandas when compared to Numpy 

Numpy : Indexing is very fast in numpy
